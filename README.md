# Robot-Arm
## Planning
### Description
Our goal is to make a robot arm that can write/draw. we will do this using a SCARA arm. The gif below is an example of what we would want our arm to do. Our robot arm will use 3 servos. 2 of them will be to move it in the x and y directions and the third wil move it up and down to be able to take the pencil/pen off the paper.

This image shows almost exactly what we want our arm to do. the only difference is that ours will have a third servo to be able to pick the pecil up.

#### Criteria: 
- Write out the word "hello"
- Be able to lift the pencil off the paper

#### Constraints:
- Time(We want to finish in February) 
- I don't know how to make the servos move together to go to the right locations yet, but I plan to learn how to do this through research and just trying it out
- I don't yet know how i am going to use a third servo to pick up the pencil/pen, but i will again research this to figure it out
