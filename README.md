## Planning
### Description
Our goal is to make a robot arm that can write/draw. we will do this using a SCARA arm. The gif below is an example of what we would want our arm to do. Our robot arm will use 3 servos. 2 of them will be to move it in the x and y directions and the third wil move it up and down to be able to take the pencil/pen off the paper. We will most likely use a button to make it start writing.

This image shows almost exactly what we want our arm to do. the only difference is that ours will have a third servo to be able to pick the pecil up.

this is a sketch of what the 3rd servo would look like and how it would pick the pencil up



### Criteria and Constraints
#### Criteria: 
- Write out the word "hello"
- Be able to lift the pencil off the paper

#### Constraints:
- Time(We want to finish in February) 
- I don't know how to make the servos move together to go to the right locations yet, but I plan to learn how to do this through research and just trying it out
- I don't yet know how i am going to use a third servo to pick up the pencil/pen, but i will again research this to figure it out 

### Materials and Cost
- Servos 	($5.95)
- Arduino	($24.95)
- Model Material ($2.43)
- Support Material ($4.76)
- #4-40 Socket Head Screws ($0.02)
- Wire ($0.08)
- Resistors	($0.04)
- AA Battery Pack	($4.00)
- Button($1.00-3.00)
 
### Scope
This project will be difficult. the hard part will probably be the code because it willl be hard to get the servos to work together in order to make a vertical line. The design and solidworks part will also be difficult to be able to connect the servos together.
